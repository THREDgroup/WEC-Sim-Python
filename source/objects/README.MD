# BEMIO Class
Read data generated from BEM solver and transition it to HDF5 file

Procedure:
1. Use CAD software(Rhinoceros 3D, SOLIDWORKS) to generate .gdf or .stl file. Rhino is preferred as SOLIDWORKS tends to generate coarse mesh.
2. Run meshConverter.py to change .gdf(Rhinoceros 3D) or .stl(SOLIDWORKS) file to .gdf(WAMIT), .dat(NEMOH), .out(AQWA) type file. 
3. Use BEM solver.
4. Place necessary files into BEMIO/data directory,
5. Run BEMIO.py to generate HDF5 file

# BEM Solver Guide (later move it to different location)
Procedure(WAMIT):

Procedure(NEMOH-Windows):
1. Download NEMOH file from 
2. create run.bat file on working directory
3. 

Procedure(NEMOH-Linux,MAC):
1. Download and extract NEMOH file
2. Go to the NEMOH directory and run make file
3. Copy all files located in the tutorial directory
4. Go to the bin directory and paste files
5. run preProc
6. run solver
7. run postProc
8. Move FKForce.tac and ..... to BEMIO/data directory

Procedure(AQWA):


# Simulation Class
1.

# Wave Class
Set up wave related varaibles and generate wave

Procedure:
1. Import necessay properties from SimulationClass
2. Generate a WaveClass(wave type)
3. Run waveSetup method to produce wave
4. Check produced wave by running plotETA method
5. Check wave spectrum for irregular wave by running plotSpectrum method

# Body Class
Set up hydroforce constants

Procedure:
1. readH5 method imports data generated by BEM solver
2.
